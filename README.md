oscat - Random Dump of OpenSCAD Stuff
=====================================

This is my personal dumping ground for various things I've written in OpenSCAD which may be handy
for other people.

The individual files will be in the `src/` directory, with documentation for them in `doc/`.

Overview
--------

### crossbrace

![crossbrace example](doc/img/crossbrace.png)

Generate a rounded crossbrace that's cut in half, for strengthening parts without using too much
material.

### torus

![torus example](doc/img/torus.png)

Generate a torus or a torus pipe (a torus with a straight middle section).

### quickmaffs

Various utility math functions.

### snek

![snek example](doc/img/snek.png)

Generate cylinders of varying dimensions along a path. Uses spheres to join them so needs decently
high `$fn` number to not look like complete doodoo.

Can also generate a `snekpipe`, which is like a `snek` but as a hollow pipe.
